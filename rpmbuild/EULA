8. U.S. Government End-Users. The Product is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202.

9. Open Source Undertaking.  Notwithstanding Section 6, if a third party makes a claim against You that Your use of the Product as provided in this Agreement infringes its intellectual property rights, Boundless, at its sole cost and expense, will defend You against the claim and indemnify you from the damages, liabilities, costs and expenses awarded by the court to the third party claiming infringement or the settlement agreed to by Boundless  up to the amounts you have paid Boundless for the Product, if you (i) notify Boundless promptly in writing, not later than 30 days after you receive notice of the claim (or sooner if required by applicable law); (ii) give Boundless sole control of the defense and any settlement negotiations; and (iii) give Boundless the information, authority, and assistance it needs to defend against or settle the claim.

If Boundless believes or it is determined that the Product may have violated a third party’s intellectual property rights, Boundless may choose to either modify the Product to be non-infringing (while substantially preserving its utility or functionality) or obtain a license to allow for continued use, or if these alternatives are not commercially reasonable, Boundless may end the license for, and require return of, the Product and refund any fees you may have paid for it.

Boundless will not indemnify you if you alter the Product or use it outside the scope of use identified in the Product’s user documentation or if you use a version of the Product which has been superseded, if the infringement claim could have been avoided by using an unaltered current version of the Product. Boundless will not indemnify you to the extent that an infringement claim is based upon any material not furnished by Boundless. Boundless will not indemnify you to the extent that an infringement claim is based upon the combination of the Product with any products or services not provided by Boundless. Boundless will not indemnify you for infringement caused by your actions against any third party if the Product as delivered to you and used in accordance with the terms of this Agreement would not otherwise infringe any third party intellectual property rights. This section provides your exclusive remedy for any infringement claims or damages.
